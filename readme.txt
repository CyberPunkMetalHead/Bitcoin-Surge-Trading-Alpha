The bot will be trading Bitcoin automatically if the price has increased by more than 3% in the last 10 minutes. 
We will have a stop loss of 5% and take profit of 8%. 
Later on, you can choose to further optimise your bot and include additional features such as trailing stop loss and close signals – but for now we’ll keep it simple.

**USE CASES**
Use with a demo account - use on a live account at your own risk
Use to test different crypto markets

**Prerequisites**

Additional resources needed (modules, software etc.) are also listed on the blog

**Considerations**
The bot can be adjusted to work with multiple cryptos at once. It currently requires a viable exit strategy.
If you test this bot please let me know your results!
Thanks for your interest in this project and good luck!
