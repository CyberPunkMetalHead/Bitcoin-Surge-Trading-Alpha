For details on the crypto trading bot please read the readme.txt file in the main branch.
This branch is only used to showcase a Push Notifications functionality for the bot. 

This branch makes use of the Spontit API in order to trigger a Push Notification to your mobile device every time the bot sucessfully places a BUY order.
You will need a secret key along with the Spontit username in order for this to work.

For more information on how it is integrated, please read the article:
